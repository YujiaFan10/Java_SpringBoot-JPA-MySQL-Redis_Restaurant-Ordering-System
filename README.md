# Restaurant Order Management System

This order management system can give merchants a one-stop shop to view and manage all customer orders in one place.

Technically speaking, this is a Java SpringBoot project which supports the entire ecommerce journey of a customer order including order placement, payment process, inventory deduction, product modification and combined with FreeMarker templates to build an admin management system.
